Simulator FAQ
--------------

Q: What do I do if I get the message: "No compiler was found -- try using a .class file instead."

A: You can either compile your ant file yourself and then give the simulator the class file, or you can try running the simulator via command line. (java -jar AntsSimulator.jar)
